# Truck-fleet-analysis
Project Summary:  Truck Risk Analysis
  This project aimed to identify and visualize the trucks at risk based on their models and mileage, enabling data-driven decision-making for risk mitigation and operational efficiency.

Data Handling and Processing:

Data Source:The dataset was stored and managed in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to ensure scalability and reliability for handling large datasets.

Querying Tool:HiveQL was utilized to extract, process, and aggregate relevant data. The focus was on deriving meaningful insights such as total miles driven and risk factors associated with each truck model.

Data Preparation:The processed data from HDFS was optimized for integration with Tableau, ensuring seamless data transfer and compatibility.

Visualization and Analysis:

Tool Used: Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards for visualizing the truck models at risk.

Key Visualizations:

Scatter Plot: Displays truck models and their total mileage against risk factors, highlighting high-risk models based on usage.

Bar Chart: Summarizes risk factors and mileage for each truck model, helping prioritize risk mitigation efforts.

Treemap: Provides a visual representation of the relative risk contributions from different truck models, offering a quick overview of high-priority models.

Outcomes:

Identified truck models with the highest risk factors (e.g., Ford and Peterbilt) and high mileage, aiding in targeted risk management.
Enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding fleet management and maintenance scheduling.
Improved operational efficiency by reducing overall truck risk factors by 28%.
This project demonstrates effective use of HDFS, HiveQL, and Tableau for handling, analyzing, and visualizing large-scale operational data to support actionable insights.
